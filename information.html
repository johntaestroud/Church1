        <h2>What We Believe</h2>
      </header> 
       <p>An <b>ETERNAL GOD</b> who is a Spirit and is everlasting throughout all generations.</p>
        
       <p>A <b>DIVINE CHRIST</b> who is the son of God and the Word of God come in the flesh.</p>
        
       <p>An <b>INFALLIBLE & INSPIRED BIBLE</b> is a non-contradictory old and new testament of the King James that harmonizes written by Holy men who wrote as God spoke to them.</p>  
        
       <p><b>SALVATION FROM SIN</b>, the life of living righteously, free from willfully committing sins that we have a clear knowledge that’s against the will of God.</p>
        
       <p>A <b>NEW BIRTH</b> is a spiritual birth, not of the flesh but of the spirit, into the family of God the church of God.</p>
        
       <p><b>ENTIRE SANCTIFICATION</b>: a work of grace upon the heart of the believer where the root of  rebellion and the inherited sin nature is purged from the heart, which is now fully submitted to the will of God. This transpires through and by a consecrated life, faith, and belief in the truth. </p> 
        
       <p><b>HOLY LIFE</b>: We teach you how to live a lifestyle that reflects the character of God. You will be consecrated and live a morally pure life in today's corrupt world.</p> 
        
       <p><b>UNITY OF GOD’S PEOPLE</b>: the world is divided because of sin, but in the church of God, we through a sanctified heart, are governed by the ruling and leading of the Holy Spirit, which causes us to walk in unity and peace. </p> 
        
       <p><b>DIVINE HEALING</b> the word comes to heal you physically, mentally, emotionally, and financially. Whatever is broken, God’s word and anointing can mend broken lives and hearts. God can divinely heal your body and give you wisdom on how to repair an unhealthy lifestyle.</p> 
        
       <p><b>THE ORDINANCES</b>: We teach you to observe what God told us to practice and that Holy Communion, which we eat bread and drink grape juice which, symbolizes the partaking of the body and blood of Jesus Christ. Feet Washing, which is the washing of one another’s feet is a symbol of humility and an endeavor to keep the unity and love amongst the church. Baptism is the full submersion under water in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</p> 
        
       <p><b>THE TRINITY</b>: We teach and believe according to the Holy Scriptures that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are three distinct divine (not human) persons in their work in the life of the believer, but all are in agreement as one. One does not work independently from the other. </p>
        
       <p><b>ETERNAL LIFE</b>: We teach and believe that we are two-fold beings consisting of both soul and body. The body is mortal and will return to the dust of the earth while the soul is eternal and will live forever beyond death, heaven being our eternal reward if the everlasting life of salvation prevails until our departure from this life.  </p>
        
       <p><b>ETERNAL PUNISHMENT</b>: We teach and believe that we are two-fold beings consisting of both soul and body. The body being mortal will return to the earth but if the soul dies in sin where God is, it will not go but rather be cast into hell eternal in torment of its flames forever.</p>
